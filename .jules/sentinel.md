## 2024-05-24 - [Unrestricted Default GitHub Token Permissions]
**Vulnerability:** The `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` workflow lacked top-level read-only permissions, which defaults to permissive permissions depending on the repository settings.
**Learning:** Even if jobs define explicit permissions, having a top-level restrictive permissions block prevents accidental leakage of write permissions to newly added jobs or actions that might inadvertently inherit broader default repository token scopes.
**Prevention:** Always declare `permissions: contents: read` (or similar restrictive top-level permissions) at the root of a GitHub Actions workflow file to enforce a secure default for the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## 2024-09-23 - [Confused Deputy ChatOps Injection]
**Vulnerability:** The ChatOps trigger `contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc')` allowed attackers to trick maintainers into quoting malicious payloads or using unrelated phrases like "ocean", inadvertently executing highly privileged commands on their behalf.
**Learning:** Using substring matching (`contains`) for trigger commands is inherently insecure because it processes contextless input, enabling Confused Deputy attacks when maintainers interact with external contributors.
**Prevention:** Always use exact matching or positional anchors (`startsWith`) for ChatOps triggers to ensure commands are executed intentionally and explicitly.
